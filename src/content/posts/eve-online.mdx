## Eve Onlinux - A Gamers Guide

Due to the reoccurring questions in the official Eve Online linux [*Discord*](https://discord.com/channels/940573867192221696/1096046348421312574) channel this guide has been created.

Thanks.

### Overview

First make sure you hardware meets the specifications listed [*here*](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/5885219196828-System-Requirements).

Then choose a <mark>distribution</mark> and a listed option. *It doesn't matter which distribution*, they all will work with the correct configurations.

The only difference is the chosen *package manager* and the *source* of the binaries.

Some are more difficult to configure than others.

<mark>No, it does not matter what linux distribution you use</mark>

The only way you will gain any performance from your hardware is by compiling the programs you are executing.

This can be done on *any distribution*, and using [*Gentoo's Portage Emerge*](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage) is highly recommended, as this will flag out many dependencies from the end binary. 

All binary served repositories are *Generic* and flag *Everything* into the end result.

The performance gains doing this could be minimal or non existent.

Also, all the following options run, on wine or a fork of wine maintained by another organization.

Changing these will result in a similar outcome as the binaries. 

<mark>*Just choose an option that works*</mark>. Some are more user friendly than others.

<mark>Bottles</mark> and <mark>Steam</mark> are the recommended user friendly options.

___

### Options
- <mark>bottles</mark> (highly recommended, can use the same modified wine as steam and other options)
- <mark>steam</mark>
- *lutris*
- *wine*

___

### Linux Notes
- any distribution works
- xdg portals is required
- compositors may affect performance 
- debian requires testing branch or backports for updated drivers and / or nvida drivers

### Troubleshooting

<mark>*Update your system and related programs before continuing!*</mark>

This is likely the <mark>*cause*</mark> of your launcher an [*Electron*](https://www.electronjs.org/) application not launching.

Usually it is a related mesa or wine update on the <mark>*SYSTEM*</mark> and your in your chosen <mark>*OPTION*</mark>.

Next check bottles and wine for available <mark>*DXVK*</mark> , <mark>*VKD3D*</mark> , and <mark>*Runner*</mark> updates.

If the runner is up to date, there are other runners available, downgrading is a possible option, but changing runners is a more likely solution.
